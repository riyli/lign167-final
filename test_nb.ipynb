In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of allopurinol per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine.  Dicumarol: It has been reported that allopurinol prolongs the half-life of the anticoagulant, dicumarol.  The clinical basis of this drug interaction has not been established but should be noted when allopurinol is given to patients already on dicumarol therapy.  The concomitant administration of uricosuric agents and allopurinol has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with allopurinol alone.  Although clinical evidence to date has not demonstrated renal precipitation of oxypurines in patients either on allopurinol alone or in combination with uricosuric agents, the possibility should be kept in mind.  Thiazide Diuretics: The reports that the concomitant use of allopurinol and thiazide diuretics may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.  In those patients in whom renal insufficiency was documented, however, the recommendation to lower the dose of allopurinol was not followed.  Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on thiazide diuretics and allopurinol even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..  Ampicillin/Amoxicillin: An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs.  Cytotoxic Agents: Enhanced bone marrow suppression by cyclophosphamide and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia, in the presence of allopurinol.  However, in a well-controlled study of patients with lymphoma on combination therapy, allopurinol did not increase the marrow toxicity of patients treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, procarbazine and/or mechlorethamine.  Chlorpropamide: Chlorpropamides plasma half-life may be prolonged by allopurinol, since allopurinol and chlorpropamide may compete for excretion in the renal tubule.  The risk of hypoglycemia secondary to this mechanism may be increased if allopurinol and chlorpropamide are given concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency.

In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of allopurinol per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine.

      "alosetron - drug - Because alosetron is metabolized by a variety of hepatic CYP drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance of alosetron.  alosetron  In a pharmacokinetic study, 40 healthy female subjects received fluvoxamine in escalating doses from 50 to 200 mg per day for 16 days, with coadministration of alosetron 1 mg on the last day.  Fluvoxamine increased mean alosetron plasma concentrations (AUC) approximately 6-fold and prolonged the half-life by approximately 3-fold.  Concomitant administration of alosetron and fluvoxamine is contraindicated.  Concomitant administration of alosetron and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including quinolone antibiotics and cimetidine, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.  In a pharmacokinetic study, 38 healthy female subjects received ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, with coadministration of alosetron 1 mg on the last day.  Ketoconazole increased mean alosetron plasma concentrations (AUC) by 29%.  Caution should be used when alosetron and ketoconazole are administered concomitantly.  Coadministration of alosetron and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as clarithromycin, telithromycin, protease inhibitors, voriconazole, and itraconazole has not been evaluated but should be undertaken with caution because of similar potential drug interactions.  The effect of induction or inhibition of other pathways on exposure to alosetron and its metabolites is not known.  In vitro human liver microsome studies and an in vivo metabolic probe study demonstrated that alosetron did not inhibit CYP enzymes 2D6, 3A4, 2C9, or 2C19.  In vitro, at total drug concentrations 27-fold higher than peak plasma concentrations observed with the 1-mg dosage, alosetron inhibited CYP enzymes 1A2 (60%) and 2E1 (50%).  In an in vivo metabolic probe study, alosetron did not inhibit CYP2E1 but did produce 30% inhibition of both CYP1A2 and N-acetyltransferase.  Although not studied with alosetron, inhibition of N-acetyltransferase may have clinically relevant consequences for drugs such as isoniazid, procainamide, and hydralazine.  Another study showed that alosetron had no clinically significant effect on plasma concentrations of the oral contraceptive agents ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel (CYP3A4 substrates).  A clinical interaction study was also conducted with alosetron and the CYP3A4 substrate cisapride.  The effect of alosetron on monoamine oxidases and on intestinal first pass secondary to high intraluminal concentrations have not been examined.  Based on the above data from in vitro and in vivo studies, it is unlikely that alosetron will inhibit the hepatic metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by the major CYP enzyme 3A4, as well as the CYP enzymes 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1, or 1A2.

In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers.

The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine;  Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug.  Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required.

      "anagrelide - drug - Limited PK and/or PD studies investigating possible interactions between anagrelide and other medicinal products have been conducted.  anagrelide  In vivo interaction studies in humans have demonstrated that digoxin and warfarin do not affect the PK properties of anagrelide, nor does anagrelide affect the PK properties of digoxin or warfarin.  Although additional drug interaction studies have not been conducted, the most common medications used concomitantly with anagrelide in clinical trials were aspirin, acetaminophen, furosemide, iron, ranitidine, hydroxyurea, and allopurinol.  There is no clinical evidence to suggest that anagrelide interacts with any of these compounds.  An in vivo interaction study in humans demonstrated that a single 1mg dose of anagrelide administered concomitantly with a single 900 mg dose of aspirin was generally well tolerated.  No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between anagrelide and acetylsalicylic acid were observed.  It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including fluvoxamine, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of anagrelide.  The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by anagrelide.

This suggests that an interaction of aripiprazole with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, or other factors, like smoking, is unlikely.  Both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for aripiprazole metabolism.  Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, carbamazepine) could cause an increase in aripiprazole clearance and lower blood levels.  Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, quinidine, fluoxetine, or paroxetine) can inhibit aripiprazole elimination and cause increased blood levels.  Ketoconazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15-mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively.  When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose.  When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased.  Quinidine: Coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of aripiprazole with quinidine (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, by 35%.  dehydroaripiprazole  Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of quinidine with aripiprazole occurs.  When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased.  Carbamazepine: Coadministration of carbamazepine (200 mg BID), a potent CYP3A4 inducer, with aripiprazole (30 mg QD) resulted in an approximate 70% decrease in Cmax and AUC values of both aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole.  dehydro-aripiprazole  When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled.  When carbamazepine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be reduced.  No clinically significant effect of famotidine, valproate, or lithium was seen on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug- Drug Interactions).  In in vivo studies, 10- to 30-mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on metabolism by CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole, warfarin), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan) substrates.  Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.

In vitro studies indicate that bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme.  bupropion  hydroxybupropion  The threohydrobupropion metabolite of bupropion does not appear to be produced by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.  threohydrobupropion  The effects of concomitant administration of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers.  Following oral administration of two 150-mg sustained-release tablets with and without 800 mg of cimetidine, the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were unaffected.  However, there were 16% and 32% increases in the AUC and Cmax, respectively, of the combined moieties of threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion.  erythrohydrobupropion  While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of bupropion (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin).  Animal data indicated that bupropion may be an inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans.  In one study, following chronic administration of bupropion, 100 mg 3 times daily to 8 healthy male volunteers for 14 days, there was no evidence of induction of its own metabolism.  Although bupropion is not metabolized by this isoenzyme, bupropion and hydroxybupropion are inhibitors of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme in vitro.  In a study of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of bupropion given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg desipramine increased the Cmax, AUC, and t1/2 of desipramine by an average of approximately 2-, 5- and 2-fold, respectively.  The effect was present for at least 7 days after the last dose of bupropion.  Concomitant use of bupropion with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 has not been formally studied.  Therefore, co-administration of bupropion with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.  If bupropion is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.  MAO Inhibitors: Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAO inhibitor phenelzine .

      "corticosteroid - group - Aminoglutethimide: Aminoglutethimide may diminish adrenal suppression by corticosteroids.  corticosteroids  Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents: When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (e.g., amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia.  Antibiotics: Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance.  corticosteroid  Anticholinesterases: Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis.  If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.  Anticoagulants, oral: Co-administration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports.  Antidiabetics: Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.  Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids.  Cyclosporine: Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently.  Ephedrine: Ephedrine may enhance the metabolic clearance of corticosteroids, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in corticosteroid dosage.  Estrogens, including oral contraceptives: Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.  Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.  Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids.  Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.  In addition, ketoconazole alone can inhibit adrenal corticosteroid synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS): Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.  Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia.  The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.

The pharmacokinetics of terfenadine and its acid metabolite and the electrocardiographic QT c interval were measured during both periods: with terfenadine alone, and with terfenadine plus dirithromycin.  in one man, the C max of terfenadine was 8.1 ng/mL with terfenadine alone and 7.2 ng/mL with terfenadine plus dirithromycin.  The mean QT c interval (msec) was 369 with terfenadine alone and 367 with terfenadine plus dirithromycin.  Also, in vitro experiments demonstrated a lack of interaction between dirithromycin and terfenadine.  Thus, the interaction observed between erythromycin and terfenadine is not expected for dirithromycin.  Theophylline: Following co-administration of two 250-mg dirithromycin tablets administered once daily with 200-mg theophylline tablets administered twice daily for 10 days to 14 healthy subjects, the steady-state plasma concentration of theophylline was not significantly altered.  In general, most patients treated with dirithromycin who are receiving concomitant theophylline therapy may not require empiric adjustment of theophylline dosage or monitoring of theophylline plasma concentrations.

Co-administration of TIKOSYN with verapamil resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased.  In an analysis of the supraventricular arrhythmia and DIAMOND patient populations, the concomitant administration of verapamil with dofetilide was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.  Ketoconazole at 400 mg daily (the maximum approved prescription dose) co-administered with TIKOSYN (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide Cmax by 53% in males and 97% in females, and AUC by 41% in males and 69% in females.  In patients receiving HCTZ alone, dofetilide AUC increased by 27% and Cmax by 21%.  The pharmacodynamic effects can be explained by a combination of the increase in dofetilide exposure and the reductions in serum potassium.  In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase dofetilide levels.  Inhibitors of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme could increase systemic dofetilide exposure.  Inhibitors of this isoenzyme (e.g., macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungal agents, protease inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, amiodarone, cannabinoids, diltiazem, grapefruit juice, nefazadone, norfloxacin, quinine, zafirlukast) should be cautiously coadministered with TIKOSYN as they can potentially increase dofetilide levels.  In patients, the concomitant administration of digoxin with dofetilide was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.

Inhibitors of CYP2D6: Because CYP2D6 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of duloxetine with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 may result in higher concentrations of duloxetine.

Potential for Duloxetine to Affect Other Drugs: Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2: In vitro drug interaction studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce CYP1A2 activity, and it is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on the metabolism of CYP1A2 substrates.  When duloxetine was administered (at a dose of 60 mg BID) in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold.  Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A: Results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not inhibit or induce CYP3A activity.  Drugs that raise the gastrointestinal pH may lead to an earlier release of duloxetine.  However, co-administration of Duloxetine with aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids (51 mEq) or Duloxetine with famotidine, had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40-mg oral dose.

No differences in adverse events or QTc interval were observed when subjects were administered fexofenadine hydrochloride alone or in combination with either erythromycin or ketoconazole.

This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. in vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, ketoconazole decreases fexofenadine gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion.  Drug Interactions with Antacids Administration of 120 mg of fexofenadine hydrochloride (2 x 60 mg capsule) within 15 minutes of an aluminum and magnesium containing antacid (Maalox ) decreased fexofenadine AUC by 41% and cmax by 43%.

      "fulvestrant - drug - Clinical studies of the effect of strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant have not been performed.  fulvestrant  In female rats, fulvestrant administered at doses   0.01 mg/kg/day (approximately one-hundredth of the human recommended dose based on body surface area [BSA], for 2 weeks prior to and for 1 week following mating, caused a reduction in fertility and embryonic survival.  The effects of fulvestrant on the fertility of female rats appear to be consistent with its anti-estrogenic activity.  The potential effects of fulvestrant on the fertility of male animals were not studied but in a 6-month toxicology study, male rats treated with intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg/30 days, 10 mg/rat/30 days, or 10 mg/rat/15 days fulvestrant showed a loss of spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules, seminiferous tubular atrophy, and degenerative changes in the epididymides.  These fulvestrant doses correspond to approximately 2-, 3-, and 3-fold the systemic exposure [AUC0-30 days] achieved in women.  approximately one-hundredth of the human recommended dose based on body surface area [BSA]), fulvestrant caused a reversible reduction in female fertility, as well as effects on embryo/fetal development consistent with its anti-estrogenic activity.  Rabbits failed to maintain pregnancy when dosed with 1 mg/kg/day fulvestrant IM (twice the human dose on BSA) during the period of organogenesis.  Because pregnancy could not be maintained in the rabbit following doses of fulvestrant of 1 mg/kg/day and above, this study was inadequate to fully define the possible adverse effects on fetal development at clinically relevant exposures.  Drug exposure in rodent pups from fulvestrant-treated lactating dams was estimated as 10% of the administered dose.  It is not known if fulvestrant is excreted in human milk. \n",

      "gabapentin - drug - In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the potential of gabapentin to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4) that mediate drug and xenobiotic metabolism using isoform selective marker substrates and human liver microsomal preparations.  gabapentin  No inhibition of any of the other isoforms tested was observed at gabapentin concentrations up to 171 mg/mL (approximately 15 times the Cmax at 3600 mg/day).  Phenytoin: In a single (400 mg) and multiple dose (400 mg TID) study of Neurontin in epileptic patients (N=8) maintained on phenytoin monotherapy for at least 2 months, gabapentin had no effect on the steady-state trough plasma concentrations of phenytoin and phenytoin had no effect on gabapentin pharmacokinetics.  Carbamazepine: Steady-state trough plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10, 11 epoxide concentrations were not affected by concomitant gabapentin (400 mg TID;  Likewise, gabapentin pharmacokinetics were unaltered by carbamazepine administration.  Valproic Acid: The mean steady-state trough serum valproic acid concentrations prior to and during concomitant gabapentin administration (400 mg TID;  N=17) were not different and neither were gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters affected by valproic acid.  Phenobarbital: Estimates of steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for phenobarbital or gabapentin (300 mg TID;  Naproxen: Coadministration (N=18) of naproxen sodium capsules (250 mg) with Neurontin (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by 12% to 15%.  Hydrocodone increases gabapentin AUC values by 14%.  Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release morphine capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg Neurontin  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.  Cimetidine: In the presence of cimetidine at 300 mg QID (N=12) the mean apparent oral clearance of gabapentin fell by 14% and creatinine clearance fell by 10%.  Thus cimetidine appeared to alter the renal excretion of both gabapentin and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.  This small decrease in excretion of gabapentin by cimetidine is not expected to be of clinical importance.  The effect of gabapentin on cimetidine was not evaluated.  Oral Contraceptive: Based on AUC and half-life, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of tablets containing 2.5 mg of norethindrone acetate and 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol were similar with and without coadministration of gabapentin (400 mg TID;  The Cmax of norethindrone was 13% higher when it was coadministered with gabapentin;  Antacid (Maalox ): Maalox reduced the bioavailability of gabapentin (N=16) by about 20%.  This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when gabapentin was administered 2 hours after Maalox.  It is recommended that gabapentin be taken at least 2 hours following Maalox administration.  This indicates that gabapentin does not undergo renal tubular secretion by the pathway that is blocked by probenecid.  Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix SG dipstick test for urinary protein when gabapentin was added to other antiepileptic drugs, the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein \n",

In a study in hypertensive patients, addition of isradipine to existing hydrochlorothiazide therapy did not result in any unexpected adverse effects, and isradipine had an additional antihypertensive effect.  Propranolol: In a single dose study in normal volunteers, coadministration of propranolol had a small effect on the rate but no effect on the extent of isradipine bioavailability.  However, concomitant administration of 5 mg b.i.d. isradipine and 40 mg b.i.d.  propranolol to healthy volunteers under steady-state conditions had no relevant effect on either drug s bioavailability, AUC and Cmax, differences were  20% between isradipine given singly and in combination with propranolol, and between propranolol given singly and in combination with isradipine.  Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of cimetidine at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of isradipine on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).  If isradipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine careful monitoring for adverse reactions is advised and downward dose adjustment may be required.  Rifampicin: In a study in healthy volunteers, a six-day course of rifampicin at 600 mg/day followed by a single 5 mg dose of isradipine resulted in a reduction in isradipine levels to below detectable limits.  If rifampicin therapy is required, isradipine concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.  Warfarin: In a study in healthy volunteers, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between isradipine and racemic warfarin was seen when two single oral doses of warfarin (0.7 mg/kg body weight) were administered during 11 days of multipledose treatment with 5 mg b.i.d. isradipine.  Neither racemic warfarin nor isradipine binding to plasma proteins in vitro was altered by the addition of the other drug.

Since this could be explained either by enhanced absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of labetalol HCl, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients.  Synergism has been shown between halothane anesthesia and intravenously administered labetalol HCl.  During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using labetalol HCl in association with halothane, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure.  The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving labetalol HCl.

Antacids and sucralfate: Sucralfate and antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, as well as formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as Videx  (didanosine), chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution can form chelation complexes with lomefloxacin and interfere with its bioavailability.  Sucralfate administered 2 hours before lomefloxacin resulted in a slower absorption (mean C max decreased by 30% and mean T max increased by 1 hour) and a lesser extent of absorption (mean AUC decreased by approximately 25%).  Magnesium- and aluminum-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with lomefloxacin, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.  Separating the doses of antacid and lomefloxacin minimizes this decrease in bioavailability;  therefore, administration of these agents should precede lomefloxacin dosing by 4 hours or follow lomefloxacin dosing by at least 2 hours.

      "valdecoxib - drug - The drug interaction studies with valdecoxib were performed both with valdecoxib and a rapidly hydrolyzed intravenous prodrug form.  valdecoxib  The results from trials using the intravenous prodrug are reported in this section as they relate to the role of valdecoxib in drug interactions.  General: In humans, valdecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via CYP 3A4 and 2C9 with glucuronidation being a further (20%) route of metabolism.  In vitro studies indicate that valdecoxib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP 2C19 (IC50 = 6  g/mL or 19  M) and 2C9 (IC50 = 13  g/mL or 41  M), and a weak inhibitor of CYP 2D6 (IC50 = 31  g/mL or 100  M) and 3A4 (IC50 = 44  g/mL or 141  M )..  Aspirin: Concomitant administration of aspirin with valdecoxib may result in an increased risk of GI ulceration and complications compared to valdecoxib alone.  Because of its lack of anti-platelet effect valdecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis.  In a parallel group drug interaction study comparing the intravenous prodrug form of valdecoxib at 40 mg BID (n=10) vs placebo (n=9), valdecoxib had no effect on in vitro aspirin-mediated inhibition of arachidonate- or collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation.  Anticonvulsants (Phenytoin): Steady state plasma exposure (AUC) of valdecoxib (40 mg BID for 12 days) was decreased by 27% when co-administered with multiple doses (300 mg QD for 12 days) of phenytoin (a CYP 3A4 inducer).  Patients already stabilized on valdecoxib should be closely monitored for loss of symptom control with phenytoin coadministration.  Coadministration with valdecoxib (40 mg BID for 7 days) resulted in a significant increase in dextromethorphan plasma levels suggesting that, at these doses, valdecoxib is a weak inhibitor of 2D6.  Even so dextromethorphan plasma concentrations in the presence of high doses of valdecoxib were almost 5-fold lower than those seen in CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary.  Lithium carbonate (450 mg BID for 7 days) had no effect on valdecoxib pharmacokinetics.  Warfarin: The effect of valdecoxib on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin (1 - 8 mg/day) was studied in healthy subjects by coadministration of BEXTRA 40 mg BID for 7 days.  While mean INR values were only slightly increased with coadministration of valdecoxib, the day-to-day variability in individual INR values was increased.  Concomitant single dose administration of valdecoxib 20 mg with multiple doses of ketoconazole and fluconazole produced a significant increase in exposure of valdecoxib.  Plasma exposure (AUC) to valdecoxib was increased 62% when coadministered with fluconazole and 38% when coadministered with ketoconazole.  Coadministration of valdecoxib (10 mg BID for 7 days) with glyburide (5 mg QD or 10 mg BID) did not affect the pharmacokinetics (exposure) of glyburide.  Coadministration of valdecoxib (40 mg BID (day 1) and 40 mg QD (days 2-7)) with glyburide (5 mg QD) did not affect either the pharmacokinetics (exposure) or the pharmacodynamics (blood glucose and insulin levels) of glyburide.  Coadministration of valdecoxib (40 mg BID (day 1) and 40 mg QD (days 2-7)) with glyburide (10 mg glyburide BID) resulted in 21% increase in glyburide AUC0-12 and a 16% increase in glyburide Cmax leading to a 16% decrease in glucose AUC0-24.  Because changes in glucose concentrations with valdecoxib coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near 70 mg/dL, dose adjustment for glyburide (5 mg QD and 10 mg BID) with valdecoxib coadministration (up to 40 mg QD) is not indicated.  Coadministration of glyburide with doses higher than 40 mg valdecoxib (e.g., 40 mg BID) have not been studied.  Coadministration with valdecoxib increased exposure of omeprazole (AUC) by 46%.  Drugs whose absorption is sensitive to pH may be negatively impacted by concomitant administration of omeprazole and valdecoxib.  Coadministration of valdecoxib with doses higher than 40 mg QD omeprazole has not been studied.  Coadministration of valdecoxib and Ortho-Novum 1/35  increased the exposure of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by 20% and 34%, respectively.  These increased exposures of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol should be taken into consideration when selecting an oral contraceptive for women taking valdecoxib.  Plasma exposure of diazepam (10 mg BID) was increased by 28% following administration of valdecoxib (40 mg BID) for 12 days, while plasma exposure of valdecoxib (40 mg BID) was not substantially increased following administration of diazepam (10 mg BID) for 12 days.  Although the magnitude of changes in diazepam plasma exposure when coadministered with valdecoxib were not sufficient to warrant dosage adjustments, patients may experience enhanced sedative side effects caused by increased exposure of diazepam under this circumstance. \n",
